            <div class="detail">It lives in saltwater oceans, but enter freshwater to spawn. They are nocturnal and are especially active at night; near their habitat, the sound of slapping water is often heard late in the quiet night. It is a carnivorous fish, feeding on small fish and crustaceans, and its breeding season is in autumn and winter.</div>

            <div class="detail">Most clownfish live in waters with clear water, plenty of light, and a water depth of more than 50 meters. Clownfish have an inextricable symbiotic relationship with sea anemones. Anemones provide shelter and protection, while clownfish clean up parasites, necrotic tissue, and organic and inorganic waste from the anemones.</div>

            <div class="detail">It inhabits the reef area facing the sea and passing by the current, and the habitat depth is about 2-40 meters. Adults usually gather in groups about 1 meter above the seafloor, while juveniles gather near coral shoots. It is known that it mainly feeds on extremely fine zooplankton and algae. This fish is distributed in the Indo-Pacific waters, including the Great Barrier Reef.</div>

            <div class="detail">They live in the sea most of their lives, but they still retain some of their ancestors' lifestyles during the evolution process, so they must return to their birthplace to lay eggs and breed offspring, forming a unique living habit. Research suggests that 52% of the world’s turtles have eaten plastic waste. The reasons are simple: a floating plastic bag can look like a lot of jellyfish, algae, or other species that make up a large component of the sea turtles’ diets.</div>

            <div class="detail">At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, and plastic makes up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and death.</div>
